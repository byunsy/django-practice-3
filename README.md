# django-practice-3

## Descriptions

This is the third Django exercise for myself to practice Django, Bootstrap, jQuery, and a little bit of Django Rest Framework. The code is an extension of django-practice-2 where I build and customize a backoffice administration page for the ecommerce shopping site created previously. The backoffice mainly uses the template called [Django Baton](https://github.com/otto-torino/django-baton), which can be installed using pip. I also utilized [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to create a simple bar chart to visualize and keep track of the number of orders per day.

## Installation

I installed Django (version 3.1.7), Django Rest Framework (version 3.12.2), and Django Baton (version 2.1.3)

```bash
pip install django
```

```bash
pip install djangorestframework
```

```bash
pip install django-baton
```
